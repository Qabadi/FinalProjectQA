            <h2>Solar-Powered Trains</h2>
            <p>Solar energy is a great way of keeping energy clean and preventing the complete
                </br>collapse of our atmosphere through the nasty and dirty air we alow to infiltrate
                </br>our ozone. This is a form of transportation that can go all day without the use
                </br>of coal or electricity. Trains usually emit a lot of air pollution so the invention of
                </br>solar-powered trains will be better as it will take energy directly from the sun to stay powered.

        <div class="para2" id="blade">
            <h2>Bladeless Wind Energy</h2>
            <p>We are used to seeing spining blades when seeing different wind turbines, but how about a wind
                </br>turbine that doesn't use spinning blades, but does the exact same job? The reason why this
                </br>would be incredibly useful is due to the fact that it will be effecient in low winds as they will
                </br>be able to operate with littel to no wind. This will also allow the communities to
                </br>generate renewable energy directly.

        <div class="para3" id="tires">
            <h2>"Rechargable" Tires</h2>
            <p>Rechargable tires are extremely useful as they are trying to be made as a very adaptable
                </br>way to meet all mobility needs for every individual. This an invention being created by Goodyear
                </br>for electric vehicles to etend the life span of tires. The idea that Goodyear is looking at is
                </br>a tire that adapts to different changes in the weather and road conditions. This change would be
                </br>safe for the environemt as Goodyear is looking to have the tires "created from a biological
                substance
                </br>and strengthened with fibres modelled with one of natureâ€™s strongest substances, spider silk". This
                </br>invention will make the tires completely biodegradable.

                All in all, these are the latest inventions revolutionizing the world of clean energy.
                </br>Each innovation, from solar-powered trains to bladeless wind energy and rechargeable tires,
                represents a significant step toward reducing our dependence on non-renewable energy sources.
                </br>These technologies not only aim to minimize environmental impact but also promote sustainability by
                harnessing renewable resources in creative and efficient ways.
                </br>As we continue to explore and develop these groundbreaking solutions, we are paving the way for a
                cleaner, greener future that benefits both the planet and future generations.
