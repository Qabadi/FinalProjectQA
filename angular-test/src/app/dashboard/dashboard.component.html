            <h2>Solar-Powered Trains</h2>
            <p>Solar energy is a great way of keeping energy clean and preventing the complete
            <br/>collapse of our atmosphere through the nasty and dirty air we alow to infiltrate 
            <br/>our ozone. This is a form of transportation that can go all day without the use
            <br/>of coal or electricity. Trains usually emit a lot of air pollution so the invention of
            <br/>solar-powered trains will be better as it will take energy directly from the sun to stay powered. </p>

            <h2>Bladeless Wind Energy</h2>
            <p>We are used to seeing spining blades when seeing different wind turbines, but how about a wind
            <br/>turbine that doesn't use spinning blades, but does the exact same job? The reason why this 
            <br/>would be incredibly useful is due to the fact that it will be effecient in low winds as they will
            <br/>be able to operate with littel to no wind. This will also allow the communities to 
            <br/>generate renewable energy directly.

        <div class="para3" id="tires" role="article" aria-labelledby="tires">
            <h2>"Rechargable" Tires</h2>
            <p>Rechargable tires are extremely useful as they are trying to be made as a very adaptable 
            <br/>way to meet all mobility needs for every individual. This an invention being created by Goodyear
            <br/>for electric vehicles to etend the life span of tires. The idea that Goodyear is looking at is 
            <br/>a tire that adapts to different changes in the weather and road conditions. This change would be
            <br/>safe for the environemt as Goodyear is looking to have the tires "created from a biological substance 
            <br/>and strengthened with fibres modelled with one of natureâ€™s strongest substances, spider silk". This 
            <br/>invention will make the tires completely biodegradable.

            <p>
                All in all, these are the latest inventions revolutionizing the world of clean energy.
                <br/>Each innovation, from solar-powered trains to bladeless wind energy and rechargeable tires, represents a significant step toward reducing our dependence on non-renewable energy sources.
                <br/>These technologies not only aim to minimize environmental impact but also promote sustainability by harnessing renewable resources in creative and efficient ways.
                <br/>As we continue to explore and develop these groundbreaking solutions, we are paving the way for a cleaner, greener future that benefits both the planet and future generations.
